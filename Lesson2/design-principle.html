		<p>The page is so user friendly that if you search categories if you know how to navigate on the first category
			it will be the same thing that you would need to do on the next categories that you need because the design of it is all the same.

		<p>The page became so simple and direct because of the white space that is has. It will immediately
			ask you what is the title of the movie that you need. The white space around the search button is 
			so helpful to focus the main action that a user want to use.

		<p>There is so much advestisement showing up in the app that you dont even know what part are you already of the app. Its confusing. Then it
			doesnt show clearly the nm nm difference between the categories and the content. Because the color of the category of it is orange the same color with its content.
			If you are new on it you wont know that the page has different sections.
